**Machine Learning and Large Language Model-Based Regressors for Predicting Surface Water Bacteria Levels Using Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation**  

This paper, accepted at the IEEE BigData conference, presents an approach leveraging machine learning and large language models (LLMs) to predict surface water bacteria levels.  

## Resources  
- **Datasets**  
  - Chicago and San Diego water quality datasets are available in the `dataset` folder.  

- **Experiments**  
  - Experiments for the Chicago dataset can be found in the `Chi.ipynb` file.  
  - Experiments combining the Chicago and San Diego datasets are in the `san-chi.ipynb` file.  

## LLM Experiments  
- **Hardware**:  
  - Conducted on GPUs (2-core A100s, each with 16GB VRAM).  
- **Run Time**:  
  - Approximately 3 hours.  
- **Code**:  
  - Available in the `GPU-runner` folder.
